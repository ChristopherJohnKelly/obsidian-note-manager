# GitHub Actions Runner Configuration

# Method 1: Personal Access Token (RECOMMENDED - automatic token management)
# Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required scope: 'repo' (full control) OR fine-grained with "Actions: Read and write" permission
# This token is used to fetch registration tokens automatically (no manual updates needed)
GITHUB_PAT=your_personal_access_token_here

# Method 2: Direct Registration Token (LEGACY - manual token management)
# Get from: GitHub Repo -> Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner
# Note: Registration tokens expire quickly (typically within 1 hour)
# Only needed if not using GITHUB_PAT
# GITHUB_RUNNER_TOKEN=your_registration_token_here

# Repository URL where the runner will be registered
REPO_URL=https://github.com/christopherjohnkelly/obsidian-notes

# Optional: Custom name for the runner (defaults to "pi-docker-runner" if not set)
RUNNER_NAME=pi-librarian
